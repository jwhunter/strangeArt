# strangeArt
This is a repository of R scripts that build art by plotting strange attractors, inspired and assisted by blogger Fronkonstin.

# Instructions
In order to create your own art, first execute all code from the strangeArt.R file.
Then, open the artLoop.R file. Set the working directory (found on line 16) to the location you want your art to be saved.
Finally, you can execute the entire artLoop and let it run! At the current presets, the function will try to make 100 pieces of art (you can change this by changing the value of the variable called "iterations" on line 52). It takes the program about 2 hours to attempt to make 100 pieces of art.
